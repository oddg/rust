An invalid cast was attempted.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0649
enum E {
    A = 0,
    B = 1
}

impl Drop for E {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

let e = E::A;
let i = e as u32;
```

Only C-like enums that do not implement Drop can be cast into an integer.
Example:

```
enum E {
    A = 0,
    B = 1
}

let e = E::A;
assert_eq!(e as u32, 0)
```

For more information about casts, take a look at the Type cast section in
[The Reference Book][1].
